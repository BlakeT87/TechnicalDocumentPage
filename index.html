            <p>Disc Golf is played like traditional golf, but with disc golf discs instead of balls and clubs. One throw
                (stroke) is counted each time the disc is thrown and when a penalty is incurred.</p>
            <p> The goal is to play each hole in the fewest strokes possible. The player with the lowest total strokes
                for the entire course wins. The hole is completed when the disc comes to rest in a disc golf basket.</p>
            <code id="definition"> DISC GOLF BASKET: Definition;
                    A Disc Golf basket is designed to catch discs and generally consists of a tray, chains, and a chain support mounted on a pole. A basket generally has a marked target area.
